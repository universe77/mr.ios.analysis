##Empirical examples
Here we tested the associations of the following phenotypes using IWV Radial MR, adding IOS as an extra weight;
   1. BMI - CHD
   2. SBP - CHD
   3. EDU - BMI
   4. Sleep - Schizophrenia 
   5. Urate - CHD
   6. Urate - eGFR
   7. CRP - CHD

##Simulation
###Does IOS accounts for pleiotropic effect indeed?
This simulation is designed to see whether decreased level of heterogeneity in MR analysis is because IOS score accounts for pleiotropic effect in MR model or just by chance.
